# Consumption Tracker

Consumption Tracker is a program that tracks daily water and calories consumption through simple user input.

This is a practice project made by a beginner with 3-4 months of learning experience. Treat it as such.

## Features:

* Management of consumption via several buttons of varying values
* Simple and straightforward display of current values
* Widget to log meal times (max 6 at once)
* Adjustable maximum values for water and calories to reasonable extents
* Option to auto-reset all values and meal times in the morning
* Selectable male/female body figures
* Function to manually reset all values and meal times
* Function to save a screenshot of the current state of application
* Light/dark mode

## Before running the program:
* Unzip all
* Make sure **CT_icons** is in the same folder as **CT.exe** (otherwise images in the application will not be displayed)

## Built with:
* [Python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* [PyQt5 5.13.0](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

## Additional notes:
* v1.0.0 source code has a severe case of spaghetto. This will likely be improved in a future release.
* CT was tested only on Windows 10, no guarantee it will work properly on other OS.
* Default folder for saved screenshots is C:\Users\User\CT_screenshots.
* The minimize to tray function is janky even by beginner standards. Will hopefully be improved later on.
